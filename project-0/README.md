# DEPS
played around with the matlab C++ APIs(mex/engine). so you will need to point your cmake at `cpp_mex_api_version.cpp`...
wherever your Matlab download puts that. Please reach out to me if you actually want to run those APIs and want help. 
I doubt that many people out there are going to want to do that lol :)
